      "content": "I should let you know how much I want you now\nfor the times have been cruel, I don't want to remember how.\nI am doing my best to pass this patience test\nStill hoping for the fateful day, surely that's the best.\n\nAre your eyes mesmerizing, that could leave me paralyzed?\nIs your voice too alluring that you had me hypnotized?\nHow about your hair, your lips, your ears and finger tips?\nAnd how could I begin to imagine when my hands are on your hips?\n\nI hope you'll be patient, I hope you'll be kind.\nBecause a guy like me surely is out of mind.\nI am far from perfect, in fact, I'm the worst.\nbut I assure you, my darling, choosing me will not be your remorse.\n\nI hope someday this poem would reach you\nthis will be a proof that I'm fervently waiting for you\nTo my future girl, whatever your name is.\nI'll call you baby, honey or darling, the only goddess that I would kiss.",
