      "content": "I should let you know how much I want you now,\nFor times have been cruel — I don’t want to remember how.\nI’m doing my best to pass this patience test,\nStill hoping for the fateful day — surely that’s the best.\n\nAre your eyes mesmerizing, enough to leave me paralyzed?\nIs your voice so alluring that it had me hypnotized?\nHow about your hair, your lips, your ears, your fingertips?\nHow could I even begin to imagine my hands upon your hips?\n\nI hope you’ll be patient, I hope you’ll be kind,\nBecause a guy like me is surely out of his mind.\nI’m far from perfect — in fact, I’m the worst,\nBut I assure you, my darling, choosing me will never be your remorse.\n\nI hope someday this poem would reach you;\nLet this be proof that I’ve been fervently waiting for you.\nTo my future girl, whatever your name is —\nI’ll call you baby, honey, or darling — the only goddess I’d wish to kiss.",
