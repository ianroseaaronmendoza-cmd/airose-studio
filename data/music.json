          "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nSeems like every day\nThese snares are in my way\nWhen I'm about to lose all the hope\nI'll say, I'll pray in Your name\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nThen Your Word will comfort me\nI know Your Word will rescue me\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I count it as gain when I suffer in pain\nLord I want to worship Your name\nLord I count it as gain, yes I'll die every day\nLord I want to worship Your name\nSo I count it, I count it as gain\n\n[Verse 2]\nWhen my future is bleak\nAnd the enemy is on his streak\nWhen I'm about to fall on my knees\nYes it's You, Your strength is in me\n\n[Pre-chorus]\nThen Your Word will comfort me\nI know Your Word will rescue me\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I count it as gain when I suffer in pain\nLord I want to worship Your name\nLord I count it as gain, yes I'll die every day\nLord I want to worship Your name\n\nSo I count it as gain when I suffer in pain\nLord I want to worship Your name\nLord I count it as gain, yes I'll die every day\nLord I want to worship Your name\nSo I count it, I count it as gain\n\n[Instrumental]\n\n[Chorus]\nSo I count it as gain when I suffer in pain\nLord I want to worship Your name\nLord I count it as gain, yes I'll die every day\nLord I want to worship Your name\n\nSo I count it as gain when I suffer in pain\nLord I want to worship Your name\nLord I count it as gain, yes I'll die every day\nLord I want to worship Your name\nSo I count it, I count it as gain",
          "story": "I think it was 2015 when I made this song. I sang it to my church and they loved it. But for me, it is more than just a worship song to be sung in the church. This song is a cry of desperation. Back then, my life seems out of place. Everything is in chaos. Depression has been a common thought. I can't even visualize my own future. Death seemed like a sweet escape. But I realized - If I'm going to die anyway, why not die for God? Yes, it is painful. Yes, it is hard. Death looked like a blessing... so what am I supposed to be afraid of? I might as well choose to worship God. If I'm losing everything, if everything is chaotic, if everything seems unsolvable - why not chose to worship? I can't think of a solution either way.\n\nHe who loses his life for God's sake will find it. I'll worship, so I made this song. Funny enough, God didn't snap His fingers and miraculously fixed everything to work in my favor. But He fixed something more important - my heart. 10 years later, I still want to worship His name.\n"
