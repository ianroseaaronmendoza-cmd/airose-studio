          "story": "I have only one goal in making this song - Just You, Jesus. A tagalog worship song that is admittedly very simple. No flairs, no acrobatics. Just Jesus. But simplicity has its own charm. Making a point cross is simpler if we make it clear. This song is an attempt to do that. I don't want anything, just You, Jesus. In my heart, just You, Jesus. Day and night, it's just You, Jesus. Why should I make it so complicated? If Jesus likes it, then everything is good. It's not for our ears to enjoy, it is for Jesus, for God alone."

          "story": "I think it was 2015 when I made this song. I sang it to my church and they loved it. But for me, it is more than just a worship song to be sung in the church. This song is a cry of desperation. Back then, my life seems out of place. Everything is in chaos. Depression has been a common thought. I can't even visualize my own future. Death seemed like a sweet escape. But I realized - If I'm going to die anyway, why not die for God? Yes, it is painful. Yes, it is hard. Death looked like a blessing... so what am I supposed to be afraid of? I might as well choose to worship God. If I'm losing everything, if everything is chaotic, if everything seems unsolvable - why not chose to worship? I can't think of a solution either way.\n\nHe who loses his life for God's sake will find it. I'll worship, so I made this song. Funny enough, God didn't snap His fingers and miraculously fixed everything to work in my favor. But He fixed something more important - my heart. 10 years later, I still want to worship His name.\n"

          "story": "This is literally my first composition! I can still remember that burning desire to make my own song for God. I'm not content with singing songs created by other artists. It's not that I'm opposed to it, but more like I want to give something special to God, like a personal \"from me to You\" moment. My own words, my own emotions, my raw voice. Admittedly, the phrasing and the technicality was not that good but I'm just happy to give it to the Lord. Years passed, I've changed the verses, added a bridge part, I even changed the title from \"I just want to sing\" to \"You are\" -- and now you're hearing the updated version of the song. But same heart and still one burning desire - I just want to sing for You, Jesus."
